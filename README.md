## How to use
Download the whole file.

Leave the Ui part, the server part and the www folder in the same file.

Open the ui and the server on R studio. If it's in the same folder, R will recognize both parts of the same app.

Click on "run app" to launch it.

The "www" folder contains the images displayed in the app that are automatically found if this folder is in the same file as the UI and Sever.
